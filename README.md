# Radiation
Developed in the Neural Networks course by: Diego Quezada and Kevin Reyes
## Objectives
- Predict solar radiation for the next 24 hours using recurrent neural networks.
- Replace missing values with a convenient method.
- Establish relationships between the variables considered through exploratory data analysis.

## Description
Recurrent neural network model to predict solar radiation for the next 24 hours.

## Conclusions
- There is a relationship in the behavior of the average hourly temperature and humidity by displacing the temperature over time.
- There is a high correlation between temperature and radiation per hour.
- Using a two-dimensional representation for the time of day increases network performance.

## Technology stack
- Numpy.
- Pandas.
- Matplotlib.
- Seaborn.
- Scikit-learn.
- Tensorflow.
- Keras.
